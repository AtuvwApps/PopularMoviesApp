# PopularMoviesApp
Popular movies was a project that I completed as part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program with Udacity. 
The app makes use of Retrofit to fetch movie data from the MovieDB API and displays it to the user in a grid format sorted by either most popular or top rated. 
The user can select a movie to see information on it, such as rating, trailers and reviews.
The user can set movies as favourites, with the movie details being stored in a local database using Room.

# Note
To run this app you must provide your own API Key for theMovieDB API.
Input your key into String API_KEY at the beginning of MainActivity.java and Movie Activity.java
